# Boilerplate code for BrewBlox Service implementations

There is some boilerplate code involved when creating a Brewblox service. This repository can be forked to avoid having to do the boring configuration.

Everything listed under **Required Changes** must be done before the package works as intended.

## How to use

* Fork this repository to your own Github account or project.
* Follow all steps outlined under the various **Required Changes**.
* Start coding your service =)
    * To test, run `pipenv run pytest`


## Files

---
### [setup.py](./setup.py)
Used to create a distributable and installable Python package. See https://docs.python.org/3.6/distutils/setupscript.html for more information.

**Required Changes:**
* Change the `name` variable to your project name. This is generally the same as the repository name. This name is used when installing the package through Pip. </br> It is common for this name to equal the package name, but using "`-`" as separator instead of "`_`".
* Change the `url` parameter to the url of your repository.
* Change the `author` parameter to your name.
* Change the `author_email` parameter to your email.


---
### [tox.ini](./tox.ini)
Developer tools such as [Tox](http://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), and [Autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) use this file to find configuration options.

**Required Changes:**
* Change `--cov=YOUR_PACKAGE` to refer to your module name.
* The `--cov-fail-under=100` makes the build fail if code coverage is less than 100%. It is optional, but recommended. Remove the `#` comment character to enable it.


---
### [.env](./.env)
Project-specific environment variables can be stored here. `Pipenv` will automatically load it when executing a command in `pipenv run`.

By default, the names of the Docker and Github repositories are stored here. They are read during the CI build.

---
### [Pipfile](./Pipfile)
[Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) is used to streamline development. It manages dependencies and virtual environments. It also automatically loads environment variables declared in `.env`.

`Pipfile` lists all dependencies. Everything under [packages] is needed for the package to run, while everything under [dev-packages] is needed to run the tests.

You can use `pipenv install <package name>` or `pipenv install --dev <package name>` to add dependencies.

**Note:** There is overlap between the [packages] section in `Pipfile`, and the `install_requires=[]` list in `setup.py`. The rule of thumb is that if you need an external package to run, you should add it to both.

**Required Changes:**
* Install pipenv (run `sudo pip3 install pipenv`)
* Update the `Pipfile.lock` file (run `pipenv lock`)
* Install all packages (run `pipenv sync -d`)


---
### [MANIFEST.in](./MANIFEST.in)
This file lists all non-code files that should be part of the package.
See https://docs.python.org/3.6/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute for more info.

For a basic service, you do not need to change anything in this file.


---
### [.editorconfig](./.editorconfig)
This file contains [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) configuration for this project. </br>
Among other things, it describes per file type whether it uses tabs or spaces.

For a basic service, you do not need to change anything in this file.
However, it is recommended to use an editor that recognizes and uses `.editorconfig` files.


---
### [README.md](./README.md)
Your module readme (this file). It will be the package description on Pypi.org, and automatically be displayed in Github.

**Required Changes:**
* Add all important info about your package here. What does your package do? How do you use it? What is your favorite color?


---
### [YOUR_PACKAGE/](./YOUR_PACKAGE/)
Your module. This name is used when importing your code in Python.

**Required Changes:**
* Rename to the desired module name. This name can't include "`-`" characters. </br>
It is common for single-module projects to use "`-`" as a separator for the project name, and "`_`" for the module. </br>
For example: `your-package` and `your_package`.


---
### [test/conftest.py](./test/conftest.py)
Project-level pytest fixtures. Some useful fixtures for testing any brewblox_service implementation are defined here. See tests in https://github.com/BrewBlox/brewblox-service/tree/develop/test for examples on how to use.

For a basic implementation, you do not need to change anything in this file.


---
### [test/test_hello.py](./test/test_hello.py)
An example on how to test aiohttp endpoints you added. Feel free to remove this once you no longer need it.


---
### [docker/amd/Dockerfile](./docker/amd/Dockerfile)
A docker file for running your package. To build, you need to copy the local version of your python package to `docker/dist/` first.

The Dockerfiles are set up so both the AMD (desktop) and ARM variants can use the same input files.

Example:
```bash
python3 setup.py sdist

rm docker/dist/*
cp dist/* docker/dist/
pipenv lock --requirements > docker/requirements.txt

docker build \
    --tag your-package:your-version \
    --file docker/amd/Dockerfile \
    docker/

# run it
docker run your-package:your-version
```

To cover the most common use cases, the `brewblox-tools` dependency defines the `bbt-localbuild` script.

It will read your .env file, run sdist, copy configuration to the docker directory, and build an image. Example:

```bash
bbt-localbuild
docker run your-package:local
```

Explore its other arguments with `bbt-localbuild --help`

**Required Changes:**
* Rename instances of `YOUR-PACKAGE` and `YOUR_PACKAGE` in the docker file to desired project and package names.


---
### [docker/arm/Dockerfile](./docker/arm/Dockerfile)
The same as for `docker/amd/Dockerfile`, but for Raspberry Pi targets.

In order to build for Raspberry, you must also first enable the ARM compiler.

Example:
```bash
python3 setup.py sdist

rm docker/dist/*
cp dist/* docker/dist/
pipenv lock --requirements > docker/requirements.txt

# Enable ARM compiler
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset

# Build the Raspberry Pi version
docker build \
    --tag your-package:rpi-your-version \
    --file docker/arm/Dockerfile \
    docker/

# Try to run Raspberry version
# On the desktop, this will fail with "standard_init_linux.go:190: exec user process caused "exec format error""
docker run --detach your-package:rpi-your-version
```

`bbt-localbuild` can also generate ARM images. It will automatically enable the QEMU compiler, and prefix the tag with `rpi-`. To use:

```
bbt-localbuild --arch arm
docker run your-package:rpi-local
```

**Required Changes:**
* Rename instances of `YOUR-PACKAGE` and `YOUR_PACKAGE` in the docker file to desired project and package names.


---
### [azure-pipelines.yml](./azure-pipelines.yml)
[Azure](https://dev.azure.com) can automatically test and deploy all commits you push to GitHub. If you haven't enabled Azure Pipelines for your repository: don't worry, it won't do anything.

To deploy your software, you will also need [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) accounts.
